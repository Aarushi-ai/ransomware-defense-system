# Ransomware Defense System using FL and PD

## Overview
This project implements a ransomware defense system using **Federated Learning (FL)** and **Proactive Defense (PD)** techniques. It detects ransomware behavior in real time and mitigates attacks using honeypots and behavioral analysis.

## Project Structure
- **Radar_Final/** – Backend implementation (Federated Learning, detection, mitigation)
- **Radar_Demo/** – Frontend / demo interface used for presentation
- **DIST/** – Executable files used to simulate ransomware attacks during demo

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Federated Learning
- Behavioral Analysis
- Honeypots
- Streamlit / Flask (for demo)

## Demo
The system was demonstrated by simulating ransomware attacks using executable files and showcasing detection and mitigation in real time.The `.exe` files used to simulate ransomware attacks are **not included in the GitHub repository** due to their size.
