# Ransomware Defense System

A prototype ransomware defense system leveraging **Federated Learning (FL)** and radar-based behavioral analysis for early ransomware detection.

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores a decentralized approach to ransomware detection where multiple clients collaboratively train detection models without sharing raw data. The system focuses on behavioral patterns commonly associated with ransomware activity.

> ⚠️ This is a research and prototype implementation and not a production-ready security solution.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Federated Learning for decentralized model training
- Behavioral radar analysis for ransomware detection
- Lightweight client-side monitoring
- Privacy-preserving threat intelligence sharing
