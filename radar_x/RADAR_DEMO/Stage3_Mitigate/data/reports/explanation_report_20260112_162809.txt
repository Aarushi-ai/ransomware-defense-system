At 2026-01-12T16:28:08.677777, RADAR-X detected suspicious
activity on your system that matched the behavior of ransomware - malicious
software that encrypts your files and demands payment.

What RADAR-X Did:
-----------------
Within 0.603999 seconds, the system:
1. Stopped the suspicious program from running
2. Protected your important folders from being changed
3. Disconnected the affected system from the network to prevent spread
4. Prepared your backup files for recovery if needed

The Result:
-----------
✓ No files were encrypted
✓ No data was lost
✓ The attack was stopped before it could cause damage
✓ Your systems are safe and protected

What This Means:

You do NOT need to pay any ransom. The attack was prevented before it could
do any harm. This is exactly what RADAR-X was designed to do - catch attacks
before they cause damage, not after.

What You Should Do:
-------------------
1. Review this report with your IT security team
2. Continue normal operations - systems are safe
3. Keep RADAR-X protection active
4. Consider additional security training if the attack came through email
